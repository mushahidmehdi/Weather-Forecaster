# Weather Forecaster.


#### In this project we will build a reponsive web application by fetching data from [weather API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/) which will forecast the average tempture for a last 15 days.

### Key Tehnologies we are using to build this web application are:
- JavaScript / React 
- Redux (to control application level state, no really needed but implemented.)
- Material UI for Icons
- Rechart Libabray 
- Sass for modular CSS writing.

#### How this application is working under the hood?
After feching data from the endpoint in Redux by triggering action from reducer and storing it into the Store to make accessable all over the application without much props drilling. Each React component is functional base and react hooks are comming here as a really handy tool to work with the application by using DRY and KISS principles.
