### Key Tehnologies we are using to build this web application are:
- JavaScript 
- ReactJS
- HTML5
- Sass for modular CSS writing. 
- Redux (to control application level state, not really needed but implemented.) 
- Npm Packages. 
- Figma 
- Firebase 

#### How this application is working under the hood?

After feching data from the endpoint in Redux by triggering action from reducer and storing it into the Store to make accessable all over the application without much props drilling. Each React component is functional base and react hooks are comming here as a really handy tool to work with the application by using DRY and KISS principles.
